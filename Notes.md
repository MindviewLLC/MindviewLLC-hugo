Travel/speaking ideas from https://charleseisenstein.net/events/#invite


To Europe: Business class travel on British Airways or Lufthansa, which I know is expensive, but that's what gets me on the plane. And expenses, so that the trip doesn't cost me anything. But I don't ask for a stipend.

If possible, extra-curricular visits to companies, business incubators, hacker spaces, other places of interest.  I also enjoy speaking at user group meetings.

I would be happy to stay in someone's guest room rather than a hotel, if that will help save money.
