If possible, extra-curricular visits to companies, business incubators, hacker spaces, other places of interest.  I also enjoy speaking at user group meetings.

I would be happy to stay in someone's guest room rather than a hotel, if that will help save money.

# International Travel

To Europe: Business class travel on British Airways or Lufthansa, which I know is expensive, but that's what gets me on the plane. And expenses, so that the trip doesn't cost me anything. But I don't ask for a stipend.

Thanks for expressing an interest in having Bruce speak or teach at your event. He is keen to help and spread the word wherever he is wanted. If something feels right, he will make every effort to be there.

That said, he has ongoing projects at home that need his presence, and it's sometimes hare to justify being away from them. Enthusiasm is key – if your group is gung-ho about Bruce’s message, that energy goes a long way in making the trip go smoothly and effortlessly. Bruce loves to be where he is really wanted.

Some things to consider:

Check the above Upcoming Event list for Conflicts - Or you may find that an event is already schedule in your area. That list is kept very up-to-date, usually six months out.

Speaking Engagements – Bruce can speak on nearly any topic and is adept at tailoring his speech to your group’s focus or interest. Usually, he prefers to speak for an hour or so and then take questions.  He also does Workshops and Retreats in length anywhere from four hours to five days on various topics: transition, money, leadership, the gift, and more. Planning as far as possible in advance of a longer workshop is helpful.

Honorarium -  While he accepts conventional arrangements for conferences and such, Bruce prefers to operate on a gift basis. For a speaking engagement, that means that he usually asks the host or the participants to make a donation baBruceBouldersed on their sense of “gratitude, propriety, and value.” He operates largely the same for a workshop, with the caveat being that he likes to ask people to reserve their spot and commit to coming by making a deposit, usually in an amount that will, in aggregate, cover his travel expenses.

Travel and Accommodations – Bruce is pretty low key about travel and accommodations. Bruce will drive himself and stay with friends whenever possible. He will occasionally bring his wife, one of his children, or his "chief plate spinner" with him. For trips that require air travel,  airfare should be covered and taken into the financial consideration of the event you are creating. Bruce usually prefers to be housed in a private home rather than in a hotel.
