I am sometimes available for consulting. If you think we can find a good fit
between us that creates an easy, effortless, enjoyable experience and meets
both your needs and mine, I'd be glad to <a href="javascript:location='mailto:\u0042\u0072\u0075\u0063\u0065\u0054\u0045\u0063\u006b\u0065\u006c\u0040\u0067\u006d\u0061\u0069\u006c\u002e\u0063\u006f\u006d';void 0">discuss possibilities.</a>

Each organization has unique needs, and I don't believe in a one-size-fits-all
style of consulting. Your organization must be seen where it is now in order to
know what steps make sense, and are possible.

Historically, my technical interests are:

1. Programming languages and tools, in particular the ways in which they can optimize the overall developer experience.

2. Object-Oriented & Functional Programming styles and tradeoffs.

3. Concurrency.

4. Dealing with errors.

Here is a partial list of my values and interests:

+ Improving developer experience, and (only) through that, productivity.

+ Creating joyful workplaces.

+ Exploring (very) different ways to think about organizations and the
development process. That's "process as in discovering how things work best
and easiest" not "process as in how do we control developers and make them
work harder."

+ Human-centered design.
