If you're in a hurry, the [Quick Links](/quicklinks) page might have what you're looking for.

Welcome. I'm Bruce Eckel and this is the website for my company, MindView. I
create books, seminars, self organizing events, and other learning experiments
and experiences.

## Consulting

I solve understanding issues around software development for teams who want to learn and improve.
I develop the skills of your team by coaching them through architecture, design, programming, and personal communication skills, in the development of your project.
Your benefit from my services is an essential part of my satisfaction, together with the interpersonal interaction around these activities.

I love taking complex ideas and simplifying them using group learning experiences and Nonviolent Communication (NVC) tools. I have been taking NVC workshops for over 10 years.

Although I've written books on numerous languages, Python---which I've used since the mid-90s---is my preferred implementation language. 
I have recently been delving into Rust, which seems to be the ideal language for writing Python extensions. I consider distributed version control, testing, and build automation to be the foundation of a reliable development process.

My skills lie in teaching, coaching, and leading architecture and code reviews. I've also had extensive experience organizing open-spaces events.

Outside my purview: Operations, security, management, agile/scrum, product management, (convincing people to use a particular language). I know about these things but do not consider them within my focus.



I foster the perspective of mutual support during group reviews.

I love automating things. Solving a problem once, freeing up my mind to solve more complicated problems.

Learning can feel vulnerable, but the sooner you reveal that you don't know something, the sooner you can start understanding it. I want to improve everyone's ability to comfortably say "I don't know." 

I enjoy the flexibility in thinking found in smaller organizations.
