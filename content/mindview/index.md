Welcome. I'm Bruce Eckel and this is the website for my company, MindView. I
create books, seminars, self organizing events, and other learning experiments
and experiences.

See the menu for various topics. If you're in a hurry, the [Quick
Links](/quicklinks) page might have what you're looking for.

Littered about the Internet you will find various partially-completed projects.
If you don't find something about it in [Quick Links](/quicklinks), chances are
it's a dead project. While I start many projects with great enthusiasm, I have
yet to find a consistent method for pruning ones that fail to take on a life of
their own.
