If you're in a hurry, the [Quick Links](/quicklinks) page might have what you're looking for.

Welcome. I'm Bruce Eckel and this is the website for my company, MindView. I
create books, seminars, self organizing events, and other learning experiences and experiments.

## Consulting

I solve understanding issues around software development for teams who want to learn and improve.
I develop skills in the context of your product by coaching your team through architecture, design, programming, and personal communication.
Your benefit from my services is an essential part of my satisfaction, together with the interpersonal interaction around these activities.

I love taking complex ideas and simplifying them using group learning experiences and Nonviolent Communication (NVC) tools. I have been taking NVC workshops for over 10 years. I foster mutual support during group reviews. 

Learning can feel vulnerable, but the sooner you reveal that you don't know something, the sooner you can start understanding it. I want to improve everyone's ability to comfortably say "I don't know." 

Although I've written books on numerous languages, Python---which I've used since the mid-90s---is my preferred implementation language. 
I have recently been delving into Rust, which seems to be the ideal language for writing Python extensions.

I consider distributed version control, testing, and build automation to be the foundation of a reliable development process. I believe that it's almost always worth automating things, primarly to reduce human error. Automation frees up minds to solve more complicated problems.

My skills lie in teaching, coaching, and leading architecture and code reviews. I've also had extensive experience organizing open-spaces events.

I am conversant in many specific areas where I do not consider myself expert enough to provide reliable advice: databases, web systems, operations, security, management, agile/scrum, product management, and certainly others.

I enjoy the flexibility in thinking that I sometimes find in smaller organizations.

If you think we can find a good fit
between us that creates an easy, effortless, enjoyable experience and meets
both your needs and mine, I'm happy to <a href='m&#97;i&#108;to&#58;B&#37;72uc&#37;&#54;&#53;TEckel&#64;&#103;%6Da&#105;l%2Ecom'>&#66;r&#117;c&#101;TEckel&#64;&#103;m&#97;i&#108;&#46;com</a>discuss possibilities.</a>
