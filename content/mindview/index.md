Welcome. I'm Bruce Eckel and this is the website for my company, MindView. I
create books, seminars, self organising events, and other learning experiments
and experiences.

See the menu for various topics. If you're in a hurry, the [Quick
Links](/quicklinks) page might have what you're looking for.

Under the right circumstances I sometimes provide consulting services. If you
think we can find a good fit between us that creates an easy, effortless,
enjoyable experience and meets both your needs and mine, I'd be glad to
discuss possibilities.

Here is a partial list of my values and interests:

+ Improving developer experience, and (only) through that, productivity.

+ Creating joyful workplaces.

+ Exploring (very) different ways to think about organizations and the
development process. That's "process as in discovering how things work best
and easiest" not "process as in how do we control developers and make them
work harder."

+ Human-centered design.

Historically, my technical interests are:

1. Programming languages and tools, in particular the ways in which they can optimize the overall developer experience.

2. Concurrency (a never-ending struggle to understand).

3. Dealing with errors.
