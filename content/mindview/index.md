If you're in a hurry, the [Quick Links](/quicklinks) page might have what you're looking for.

Welcome. I'm Bruce Eckel and this is the website for my company, MindView. I
create books, seminars, self organizing events, and other learning experiments
and experiences.

## Consulting

I solve understanding issues around software development for teams who want to learn and improve.
I develop the architecture, design, and programming skills of your team by coaching them through their project. Using your project as the learning example.
I coach your team in programming, design, architecture, and interpersonal communication skills. Your benefit from my services is an essential part of my satisfaction. 

I love taking complex ideas and simplifying them using group learning experiences and nonviolent communication tools.

Although I've written books on numerous languages, Python


Languages and tools directly related to the programming process.

Within my purview: Teaching, coaching, reviews.
Outside my purview: Operations, security, management, agile/scrum, product management, (convincing people to use a particular language). I know about these things but do not consider them within my focus.

I consider distributed version control, testing, and build automation to be the foundation of a reliable development process.

I foster the perspective of mutual support during group reviews.

My greatest satisfaction comes from interpersonal interaction around these activities. Almost all my consulting activities revolve around this.

I love automating things. Solving a problem once, freeing up my mind to solve more complicated problems.

Learning can feel vulnerable, but the sooner you reveal that you don't know something, the sooner you can start understanding it. I want to improve everyone's ability to comfortably say "I don't know." 

I enjoy the flexibility in thinking found in smaller organizations.
