A *developer retreat* creates a space in the Rocky Mountains for you to change
your environment for awhile, surrounded by like-minded people. You can either
continue your regular work or explore something new and different---there is no
agenda.

We often have coffee or meals together, and spontaneously organize other
activities. There is no formal structure. Conversations and new ideas may
happen.

The retreat takes place at <a href="https://www.evolvework.co" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolve Coworking</a> in Crested Butte, where you'll
find comfortable Aeron-style chairs and high-speed fiber. Crested Butte is full
of restaurants, coffee shops and opportunities for non-work outdoor activities.

You are responsible for your own travel, lodging, and meals, but people often:

- Carpool up from Denver airport
- Rent houses together
- Eat together
