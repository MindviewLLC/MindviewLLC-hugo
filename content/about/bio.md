## AV Requirements:

I give presentations from my notebook computer (a Dell Windows 10 Machine
with HDMI connector), so unless otherwise specified you should provide a
computer projection system that will handle at least Super VGA output of
**1024 x 768**. If the room or audience warrants it, you should also provide a
PA system and microphone. If I'm giving a straight presentation without
exercises, then that should be enough; if there are exercises involved then
everyone usually brings notebook computers with the appropriate tools loaded
and pre-tested (unless you have a training room equipped with computers).
